### ðŸ›  Fixing Your Code:

1. **Color Comparison Error**
   You're checking `selectedColor === green`, but `green` is not defined.
   ðŸ‘‰ Hint: Use string literals for color names (e.g., `'green'` instead of `green`).

2. **`if else` Syntax Issue**
   Your `if else` statements are not valid JavaScript.
   ðŸ‘‰ Hint: The correct syntax is `else if`, not `if else`.

3. **Invalid `style` Prop**
   You're using `style={text-color:{value}}`, which is not valid JSX.
   ðŸ‘‰ Hint: The `style` prop takes an object. Use camelCase for CSS properties like `color`.

4. **Casing Mismatch**
   Youâ€™re passing `value` to `Test1Child`, but it's not used inside.
   ðŸ‘‰ Hint: You donâ€™t actually need to pass `value` unless you're using it inside the child.

5. **Capitalization in Options**
   You're comparing `'Green'`, `'Red'`, etc., but setting the state as lowercase `'green'` etc.
   ðŸ‘‰ Hint: Make sure the case matches when comparing strings.
