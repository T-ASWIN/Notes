### **1. Total Marks from Obtained Marks**

**Question:** A student scores 360 marks and fails by 40 marks. If the pass percentage is 50%, what are the total marks?

**Answer:**
Let total marks = `x`
Pass marks = 360 + 40 = 400
50% of `x` = 400 ⇒ x = **800**

---

### **2. Required Marks to Pass**

**Question:** A student who scores 30% marks fails by 60 marks, while another who scores 40% gets 20 marks more than the pass marks. Find the total marks.

**Answer:**
Let total marks = `x`
x/3 + 60 = 2x/5 - 20
⇒ 5x + 900 = 6x - 300
⇒ x = **1200**

---

### **3. Subject-Wise Percentage**

**Question:** A student scores 72% in Math, 68% in Physics, and 58% in Chemistry. Each subject is out of 200. What is the overall percentage?

**Answer:**
Total marks = 600
Obtained marks = 144 + 136 + 116 = 396
Percentage = (396 / 600) × 100 = **66%**

---

### **4. Reverse Calculation from Percentage**

**Question:** A student scores 180 marks, which is 45% of the total marks. What are the total marks?

45% of `x` = 180 ⇒ x = (180 × 100) / 45 = **400**

---

### **5. Pass and Fail Percentage**

**Question:** In an exam, 80% students passed in English, 85% passed in Math, and 15% failed in both. What percentage of students passed in at least one subject?

**Question:** A student scored 75% in paper I (200 marks), 60% in paper II (300 marks), and 80% in paper III (500 marks). What is his overall percentage?

**Answer:**
Total obtained = 150 + 180 + 400 = 730
Total marks = 1000
Overall percentage = (730 / 1000) × 100 = **73%**

---

### **7. Percentage Increase in Marks**
