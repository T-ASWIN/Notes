## 🌐 What is HTTP?

**HTTP** stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**. It's the **language that web browsers and web servers use to communicate** with each other.

* It helps transfer **HTML pages, images, videos, or data** between a **client** (like your browser) and a **server** (where websites live).
* Though it was originally made for websites, HTTP is now also used for apps, APIs, and even **machine-to-machine communication**.

---

## 🔄 How HTTP Works

HTTP follows a **client-server model**:

1. A **client** (like Chrome, Firefox, or a mobile app) sends a **request** to a **server** (where the data lives).
2. The **server responds** with the requested information (like a webpage, image, or data).

### Example:

When you type `www.google.com` and press enter:

* Your browser sends an HTTP **GET request** to Google’s server.
* The server replies with the **Google homepage**.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features of HTTP

* **Stateless**: Every HTTP request is independent. The server doesn’t remember anything about previous requests.
  ➤ However, **cookies** were introduced later to **store small data** like login sessions.

---

## 📬 HTTP Requests & Responses

### 🔹 Request

When the browser asks the server for something.

Main parts:

* **Method** (e.g. GET, POST)
* **URL**
* **Headers** (info like browser type, language)
* **Body** (for sending data in POST)

### 🔹 Response

The server sends back:

* **Status code** (e.g. 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
* **Headers**
* **Body** (the actual webpage or data)

---

## 📌 Important HTTP Concepts

### ✅ Request Methods:

Tell the server what the client wants to do.

* `GET` – Retrieve data
* `POST` – Send data (like forms)
* `PUT` – Update data
* `DELETE` – Remove data

### ✅ Status Codes:

Tell whether the request was successful:

* `200` – OK
* `301` – Redirect
* `404` – Not Found
* `500` – Server Error

---

## 📄 HTTP Headers

Headers are extra info sent with the request or response.

Examples:

* `Content-Type`: What kind of file is being sent (`text/html`, `application/json`)
* `Authorization`: Used for login/authentication
* `User-Agent`: Info about the browser

---

## 🧠 Advanced Features of HTTP

### 🍪 Cookies:

Used to **store data** (like login sessions). Set by the server and sent back by the browser in future requests.

### 🛠 Caching:

Helps **store copies of files** so websites load faster without making repeated server requests.

### 🔐 Authentication:

Used to check if the user is allowed to access a certain resource.

### 🔄 Redirects:

If a resource has moved, the server sends a new location (URL), and the browser follows it.

---

## 🔐 HTTP Security

### 🔸 CSP (Content Security Policy):

Limits what types of content (scripts, images) a page can load. Prevents **XSS attacks**.

### 🔸 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

Controls which websites can request resources from your site. Important for **web APIs**.

### 🔸 Permissions Policy:

Lets the site control **which browser features** (like camera, location) are allowed.

---

## 🌍 HTTP Versions

HTTP has improved over time:

* **HTTP/1.0** – Basic version
* **HTTP/1.1** – Persistent connections (don’t close after each request)
* **HTTP/2** – Faster with parallel requests
* **HTTP/3** – Uses a newer protocol (QUIC) for speed and security

---

## 🔍 Developer Tools

Here are some tools to help developers debug or test HTTP:

* **Browser DevTools → Network tab** (to see requests/responses)
* **curl** – Command-line tool to make HTTP requests
* **RedBot** – Tests your caching settings
* **nghttp2** – HTTP/2 testing tool
* **HTTP Observatory** – Tests website security

## **1. What are `async` and `await`?**

They are just **syntax sugar** for working with **Promises** in a cleaner, more readable way.
Instead of chaining `.then().catch()`, you can write code that *looks* synchronous but is still asynchronous.

---

### **How it works**

* `async` → put it before a function to tell JavaScript **"this function will return a Promise"**.
* `await` → pause inside an `async` function **until the Promise is resolved or rejected**.

---

### **Example without async/await**:

```javascript
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

---

### **Same Example with async/await**:

```javascript
async function getPost() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

getPost();
```

Looks much cleaner, right?

---

## **2. Why use async/await?**

✅ More readable code (looks like normal step-by-step instructions)
✅ Easier error handling with `try...catch`
✅ No messy `.then()` chaining

---

## **3. Real React Example with async/await**

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function JokeFetcher() {
  const [joke, setJoke] = useState("");
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchJoke() {
      try {
        const res = await fetch("https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke");
        const data = await res.json();
        setJoke(`${data.setup} - ${data.punchline}`);
      } catch (err) {
        setJoke("Failed to load joke 😢");
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }
    fetchJoke();
  }, []);

  return loading ? <p>Loading...</p> : <p>{joke}</p>;
}
```
