## üåê What is HTTP?

**HTTP** stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**. It's the **language that web browsers and web servers use to communicate** with each other.

* It helps transfer **HTML pages, images, videos, or data** between a **client** (like your browser) and a **server** (where websites live).
* Though it was originally made for websites, HTTP is now also used for apps, APIs, and even **machine-to-machine communication**.

---

## üîÑ How HTTP Works

HTTP follows a **client-server model**:

1. A **client** (like Chrome, Firefox, or a mobile app) sends a **request** to a **server** (where the data lives).
2. The **server responds** with the requested information (like a webpage, image, or data).

### Example:

When you type `www.google.com` and press enter:

* Your browser sends an HTTP **GET request** to Google‚Äôs server.
* The server replies with the **Google homepage**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features of HTTP

* **Stateless**: Every HTTP request is independent. The server doesn‚Äôt remember anything about previous requests.
  ‚û§ However, **cookies** were introduced later to **store small data** like login sessions.

---

## üì¨ HTTP Requests & Responses

### üîπ Request

When the browser asks the server for something.

Main parts:

* **Method** (e.g. GET, POST)
* **URL**
* **Headers** (info like browser type, language)
* **Body** (for sending data in POST)

### üîπ Response

The server sends back:

* **Status code** (e.g. 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
* **Headers**
* **Body** (the actual webpage or data)

---

## üìå Important HTTP Concepts

### ‚úÖ Request Methods:

Tell the server what the client wants to do.

* `GET` ‚Äì Retrieve data
* `POST` ‚Äì Send data (like forms)
* `PUT` ‚Äì Update data
* `DELETE` ‚Äì Remove data

### ‚úÖ Status Codes:

Tell whether the request was successful:

* `200` ‚Äì OK
* `301` ‚Äì Redirect
* `404` ‚Äì Not Found
* `500` ‚Äì Server Error

---

## üìÑ HTTP Headers

Headers are extra info sent with the request or response.

Examples:

* `Content-Type`: What kind of file is being sent (`text/html`, `application/json`)
* `Authorization`: Used for login/authentication
* `User-Agent`: Info about the browser

---

## üß† Advanced Features of HTTP

### üç™ Cookies:

Used to **store data** (like login sessions). Set by the server and sent back by the browser in future requests.

### üõ† Caching:

Helps **store copies of files** so websites load faster without making repeated server requests.

### üîê Authentication:

Used to check if the user is allowed to access a certain resource.

### üîÑ Redirects:

If a resource has moved, the server sends a new location (URL), and the browser follows it.

---

## üîê HTTP Security

### üî∏ CSP (Content Security Policy):

Limits what types of content (scripts, images) a page can load. Prevents **XSS attacks**.

### üî∏ CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

Controls which websites can request resources from your site. Important for **web APIs**.

### üî∏ Permissions Policy:

Lets the site control **which browser features** (like camera, location) are allowed.

---

## üåç HTTP Versions

HTTP has improved over time:

* **HTTP/1.0** ‚Äì Basic version
* **HTTP/1.1** ‚Äì Persistent connections (don‚Äôt close after each request)
* **HTTP/2** ‚Äì Faster with parallel requests
* **HTTP/3** ‚Äì Uses a newer protocol (QUIC) for speed and security

---

## üîç Developer Tools

Here are some tools to help developers debug or test HTTP:

* **Browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab** (to see requests/responses)
* **curl** ‚Äì Command-line tool to make HTTP requests
* **RedBot** ‚Äì Tests your caching settings
* **nghttp2** ‚Äì HTTP/2 testing tool
* **HTTP Observatory** ‚Äì Tests website security
