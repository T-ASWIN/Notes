### 🧠 Example:

#### ✅ No Side Effect:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

> It just returns a value. Nothing else happens. No side effect.

---

#### ❌ With Side Effect:

```js
function saveName(name) {
  localStorage.setItem('userName', name);
}
```

> This affects something **outside the function** (localStorage). That's a side effect.

### 🧾 Common Side Effects in React:

* Fetching data (`fetch`, `axios`)
* Changing the DOM manually
* Using `setTimeout` or `setInterval`
* Logging to the console
* Saving to local storage
* Subscribing to events (like window resize)
* Updating a global variable or browser tab title

---

### 💡 Why it matters in React:

React is **declarative** — it wants to manage the UI **based on state**.
So, you need to tell React **when** and **how** to run side effects using `useEffect()` — so it doesn't run them at the wrong time.

---

### 📌 In short:

> A **side effect** is anything that **touches or changes something outside your function.**
> React controls this using the `useEffect` hook.


---

## ✅ What is `useEffect`?

### 🧠 Simple definition:

> `useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you **run side effects** in your component **after** the UI has been updated (rendered).

---

### 🧾 Common examples of side effects:

* Fetching data from an API
* Getting the user's location
* Saving or reading from `localStorage`
* Setting up event listeners or timers

---

## 🔧 Syntax:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // your side effect code here
}, [dependencies]);
```

---

## 📌 Meaning of `useEffect(() => {}, [])`

### 🔹 `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`

* `()` → this is a function where your side-effect code goes.
* `[]` → this is the **dependency array**.

### 💬 In simple words:

> Run this code **only once** after the component is rendered the **first time** (like `componentDidMount` in class components).

---

### 🧪 Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted!");
}, []);
```

> ✅ This runs **once**, when the component loads (not on every render).

---

## 💡 Explanation of Your Point #21:

```js
useEffect(() => {}, []);
```

* This is a **blank side effect**.
* It runs only once (because of the empty array `[]`), but does nothing.
* In real use, you’ll fill it with some side-effect logic like getting data, location, etc.

---

## 🔄 Dependency Array — More Detail

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("This runs when count changes");
}, [count]);
```

> This runs the code **only when `count` changes**.

---

## ✅ Your Other Points (16–20) Explained:

### 🔸16) Side effects are tasks that don’t impact the current render

✅ Correct. They run **outside** the regular UI flow, like:

* Getting location
* Talking to APIs
* Saving data to localStorage

---

### 🔸17) useEffect must be inside the component function

✅ Yes! It behaves like state (`useState`) and **can’t be placed outside, inside loops, or conditions**.

---

### 🔸18) `navigator`, `localStorage`, `JSON` are browser features

✅ Exactly. These are **built into the browser**, not React:

* `navigator.geolocation` – for location
* `localStorage` – for storing data
* `JSON.stringify()` / `JSON.parse()` – to convert objects to/from strings

---

### 🔸19) Hooks like `useEffect` must not be inside loops or `if`

✅ Right! React needs to know the **order of hooks**, so you must write:

```js
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // okay
  }, []);
}
```

❌ Not allowed:

```js
if (someCondition) {
  useEffect(() => {}, []); // ❌
}
```

---

### 🔸20) Not every side effect needs `useEffect`

✅ True. You use `useEffect` **only when**

* You want something to run **after** the component renders
* You want to avoid **infinite loops** or delays

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useEffect(() => {}, [])`        | Run once when component mounts                                                  |
| `useEffect(() => {}, [x])`       | Run when `x` changes                                                            |
| `useEffect(() => {})` (no array) | Run after **every render**                                                      |
| Side effects                     | Code that interacts with the outside world (location, fetch, storage)           |
| Hooks rule                       | Must be at top level in your component, not in `if`, loops, or nested functions |
