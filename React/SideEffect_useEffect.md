### üß† Example:

#### ‚úÖ No Side Effect:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

> It just returns a value. Nothing else happens. No side effect.

---

#### ‚ùå With Side Effect:

```js
function saveName(name) {
  localStorage.setItem('userName', name);
}
```

> This affects something **outside the function** (localStorage). That's a side effect.

---

### üßæ Common Side Effects in React:

* Fetching data (`fetch`, `axios`)
* Changing the DOM manually
* Using `setTimeout` or `setInterval`
* Logging to the console
* Saving to local storage
* Subscribing to events (like window resize)
* Updating a global variable or browser tab title

---

### üí° Why it matters in React:

React is **declarative** ‚Äî it wants to manage the UI **based on state**.
So, you need to tell React **when** and **how** to run side effects using `useEffect()` ‚Äî so it doesn't run them at the wrong time.

---

### üìå In short:

> A **side effect** is anything that **touches or changes something outside your function.**
> React controls this using the `useEffect` hook.


---

## ‚úÖ What is `useEffect`?

### üß† Simple definition:

> `useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you **run side effects** in your component **after** the UI has been updated (rendered).

---

### üßæ Common examples of side effects:

* Fetching data from an API
* Getting the user's location
* Saving or reading from `localStorage`
* Setting up event listeners or timers

---

## üîß Syntax:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // your side effect code here
}, [dependencies]);
```

---

## üìå Meaning of `useEffect(() => {}, [])`

### üîπ `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`

* `()` ‚Üí this is a function where your side-effect code goes.
* `[]` ‚Üí this is the **dependency array**.

### üí¨ In simple words:

> Run this code **only once** after the component is rendered the **first time** (like `componentDidMount` in class components).

---

### üß™ Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted!");
}, []);
```

> ‚úÖ This runs **once**, when the component loads (not on every render).

---

## üí° Explanation of Your Point #21:

```js
useEffect(() => {}, []);
```

* This is a **blank side effect**.
* It runs only once (because of the empty array `[]`), but does nothing.
* In real use, you‚Äôll fill it with some side-effect logic like getting data, location, etc.

---

## üîÑ Dependency Array ‚Äî More Detail

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("This runs when count changes");
}, [count]);
```

> This runs the code **only when `count` changes**.

---

## ‚úÖ Your Other Points (16‚Äì20) Explained:

### üî∏16) Side effects are tasks that don‚Äôt impact the current render

‚úÖ Correct. They run **outside** the regular UI flow, like:

* Getting location
* Talking to APIs
* Saving data to localStorage

---

### üî∏17) useEffect must be inside the component function

‚úÖ Yes! It behaves like state (`useState`) and **can‚Äôt be placed outside, inside loops, or conditions**.

---

### üî∏18) `navigator`, `localStorage`, `JSON` are browser features

‚úÖ Exactly. These are **built into the browser**, not React:

* `navigator.geolocation` ‚Äì for location
* `localStorage` ‚Äì for storing data
* `JSON.stringify()` / `JSON.parse()` ‚Äì to convert objects to/from strings

---

### üî∏19) Hooks like `useEffect` must not be inside loops or `if`

‚úÖ Right! React needs to know the **order of hooks**, so you must write:

```js
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // okay
  }, []);
}
```

‚ùå Not allowed:

```js
if (someCondition) {
  useEffect(() => {}, []); // ‚ùå
}
```

---

### üî∏20) Not every side effect needs `useEffect`

‚úÖ True. You use `useEffect` **only when**

* You want something to run **after** the component renders
* You want to avoid **infinite loops** or delays

## üß† Final Summary

| Feature                          | Meaning                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useEffect(() => {}, [])`        | Run once when component mounts                                                  |
| `useEffect(() => {}, [x])`       | Run when `x` changes                                                            |
| `useEffect(() => {})` (no array) | Run after **every render**                                                      |
| Side effects                     | Code that interacts with the outside world (location, fetch, storage)           |
| Hooks rule                       | Must be at top level in your component, not in `if`, loops, or nested functions |

---

## üî∏ **23) When we pass a function as a dependency in `useEffect`, it causes problems**

‚úÖ This is **true**, and here‚Äôs **why**:

### üîπ Functions are objects in JavaScript

Every time your component **re-renders**, a function defined inside it (like `handleClick` or `fetchData`) is **created again** ‚Äî a **new object in memory**.

So this:

```js
function hello1() {
  console.log("hello");
}

function hello2() {
  console.log("hello");
}

console.log(hello1 === hello2); // ‚ùå false
```

Even though the code is **exactly the same**, JavaScript treats each function as a **different object** in memory.
This is what you're saying in **point 24** ‚Äî and you're 100% correct.

---

## üîÅ So What Happens in `useEffect`?

### üëá Example:

```js
function App() {
  function fetchData() {
    // fetch something...
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [fetchData]); // ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem!
}
```

This causes the `useEffect` to run on **every render**, because:

* `fetchData` is a **new function** each time,
* so `[fetchData]` is always considered **changed**.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Fix It?

### Use `useCallback()` to **memoize** the function:

```js
const fetchData = useCallback(() => {
  // fetch something...
}, []);
```

Now React **remembers the same function**, and won‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúnew‚Äù every time ‚Äî avoiding unnecessary re-runs of `useEffect`.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept                 | Explanation                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `function === function` | Always false unless it's the **same exact instance** |
| `useEffect([function])` | Causes reruns unless you use `useCallback`           |
| Fix                     | Use `useCallback()` to memoize the function          |
| Why this matters        | Prevents unnecessary re-renders or infinite loops    |
