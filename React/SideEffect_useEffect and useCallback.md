### 🧠 Example:

#### ✅ No Side Effect:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

> It just returns a value. Nothing else happens. No side effect.

---

#### ❌ With Side Effect:

```js
function saveName(name) {
  localStorage.setItem('userName', name);
}
```

> This affects something **outside the function** (localStorage). That's a side effect.

---

### 🧾 Common Side Effects in React:

* Fetching data (`fetch`, `axios`)
* Changing the DOM manually
* Using `setTimeout` or `setInterval`
* Logging to the console
* Saving to local storage
* Subscribing to events (like window resize)
* Updating a global variable or browser tab title

---

### 💡 Why it matters in React:

React is **declarative** — it wants to manage the UI **based on state**.
So, you need to tell React **when** and **how** to run side effects using `useEffect()` — so it doesn't run them at the wrong time.

---

### 📌 In short:

> A **side effect** is anything that **touches or changes something outside your function.**
> React controls this using the `useEffect` hook.


---

## ✅ What is `useEffect`?

### 🧠 Simple definition:

> `useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you **run side effects** in your component **after** the UI has been updated (rendered).

---

### 🧾 Common examples of side effects:

* Fetching data from an API
* Getting the user's location
* Saving or reading from `localStorage`
* Setting up event listeners or timers

---

## 🔧 Syntax:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // your side effect code here
}, [dependencies]);
```

---

## 📌 Meaning of `useEffect(() => {}, [])`

### 🔹 `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`

* `()` → this is a function where your side-effect code goes.
* `[]` → this is the **dependency array**.

### 💬 In simple words:

> Run this code **only once** after the component is rendered the **first time** (like `componentDidMount` in class components).

---

### 🧪 Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted!");
}, []);
```

> ✅ This runs **once**, when the component loads (not on every render).

---

## 💡 Explanation of Your Point #21:

```js
useEffect(() => {}, []);
```

* This is a **blank side effect**.
* It runs only once (because of the empty array `[]`), but does nothing.
* In real use, you’ll fill it with some side-effect logic like getting data, location, etc.

---

## 🔄 Dependency Array — More Detail

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("This runs when count changes");
}, [count]);
```

> This runs the code **only when `count` changes**.

---

## ✅ Your Other Points (16–20) Explained:

### 🔸16) Side effects are tasks that don’t impact the current render

✅ Correct. They run **outside** the regular UI flow, like:

* Getting location
* Talking to APIs
* Saving data to localStorage

---

### 🔸17) useEffect must be inside the component function

✅ Yes! It behaves like state (`useState`) and **can’t be placed outside, inside loops, or conditions**.

---

### 🔸18) `navigator`, `localStorage`, `JSON` are browser features

✅ Exactly. These are **built into the browser**, not React:

* `navigator.geolocation` – for location
* `localStorage` – for storing data
* `JSON.stringify()` / `JSON.parse()` – to convert objects to/from strings

---

### 🔸19) Hooks like `useEffect` must not be inside loops or `if`

✅ Right! React needs to know the **order of hooks**, so you must write:

```js
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // okay
  }, []);
}
```

❌ Not allowed:

```js
if (someCondition) {
  useEffect(() => {}, []); // ❌
}
```

---

### 🔸20) Not every side effect needs `useEffect`

✅ True. You use `useEffect` **only when**

* You want something to run **after** the component renders
* You want to avoid **infinite loops** or delays

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useEffect(() => {}, [])`        | Run once when component mounts                                                  |
| `useEffect(() => {}, [x])`       | Run when `x` changes                                                            |
| `useEffect(() => {})` (no array) | Run after **every render**                                                      |
| Side effects                     | Code that interacts with the outside world (location, fetch, storage)           |
| Hooks rule                       | Must be at top level in your component, not in `if`, loops, or nested functions |

---

## 🔸 **23) When we pass a function as a dependency in `useEffect`, it causes problems**

✅ This is **true**, and here’s **why**:

### 🔹 Functions are objects in JavaScript

Every time your component **re-renders**, a function defined inside it (like `handleClick` or `fetchData`) is **created again** — a **new object in memory**.

So this:

```js
function hello1() {
  console.log("hello");
}

function hello2() {
  console.log("hello");
}

console.log(hello1 === hello2); // ❌ false
```

Even though the code is **exactly the same**, JavaScript treats each function as a **different object** in memory.
This is what you're saying in **point 24** — and you're 100% correct.

---

## 🔁 So What Happens in `useEffect`?

### 👇 Example:

```js
function App() {
  function fetchData() {
    // fetch something...
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [fetchData]); // ⚠️ Problem!
}
```

This causes the `useEffect` to run on **every render**, because:

* `fetchData` is a **new function** each time,
* so `[fetchData]` is always considered **changed**.

---

## ✅ How to Fix It?

### Use `useCallback()` to **memoize** the function:

```js
const fetchData = useCallback(() => {
  // fetch something...
}, []);
```

Now React **remembers the same function**, and won’t think it’s “new” every time — avoiding unnecessary re-runs of `useEffect`.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept                 | Explanation                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `function === function` | Always false unless it's the **same exact instance** |
| `useEffect([function])` | Causes reruns unless you use `useCallback`           |
| Fix                     | Use `useCallback()` to memoize the function          |
| Why this matters        | Prevents unnecessary re-renders or infinite loops    |

---


## ✅ 25) `useCallback` — Why and How We Use It

### 🔹 Your point:

> "We use this to wrap it around the function. It is similar to useEffect but it stores the function in memory..."

Yes! That's mostly right. Let's refine it a little.

---

### 🔧 What is `useCallback`?

> `useCallback` is a React Hook that **remembers (memoizes)** a function so that it **doesn’t get re-created** every time the component re-renders.

### 🧠 Why use it?

To prevent **unnecessary re-renders** or **infinite loops** when:

* Passing a function to `useEffect`
* Passing a function as a prop to child components (to avoid child re-rendering)

---

### ✅ Syntax:

```js
const memoizedFunction = useCallback(() => {
  // function code
}, [dependencies]);
```

---

### 🔁 Difference from `useEffect`

| Hook          | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useEffect`   | Runs code **after render**                               |
| `useCallback` | **Stores a function** to avoid recreating it each render |

---

### 🧪 Example:

```js
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Clicked!");
}, []);
```

Now `handleClick` stays the **same** between renders (same memory reference).

---

## ✅ 26) Dependency Array — What and Why

### 🔹 Your point:

> "Dependency we need to provide props or state for that"

✅ Exactly! Let me explain it a bit more:

---

### 🧾 What is the Dependency Array?

The array in:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // effect code
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

Or in:

```js
useCallback(() => {
  // function code
}, [dependency1]);
```

It tells React:

> "Only re-run this function or effect when **these values change**."

---

### 🔥 If you don’t include the right dependencies:

* You may get **stale data**
* You might miss updates
* Or you might have **infinite loops**

---

### ✅ Good examples of dependencies:

* `state` variables
* `props` passed from parent
* values used **inside the function**

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

| Concept                 | What it Means                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useCallback`           | Remembers a function so it's **not recreated** every render |
| `useEffect`             | Runs side effects **after render**                          |
| Dependency Array (`[]`) | Tells React **when to run** the hook again                  |
| Include in deps         | Any state or props used inside the function/effect          |

---

## ✅ Scenario:

We have:

* A **parent** component with a button and a count
* A **child** component that receives a function as a prop

We'll show:

1. What happens **without** `useCallback`
2. How `useCallback` **fixes** unnecessary re-rendering

---

## 🔧 Code Example

### 🔹 1. Child Component (`Child.jsx`)

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Child({ onClick }) {
  console.log("Child rendered 👶");

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Child Component</h3>
      <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default React.memo(Child);
```

> 🔹 `React.memo` is used to **prevent re-rendering unless props change**.

---

### 🔹 2. Parent Component (`App.jsx`)

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import Child from './Child';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // ❌ Without useCallback — new function every time
  // const handleClick = () => {
  //   console.log("Button clicked!");
  // };

  // ✅ With useCallback — function is remembered
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Parent Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>

      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 🔍 What Happens:

### ✅ With `useCallback`:

* `handleClick` doesn't change on re-render
* ✅ Child component **doesn't re-render** when parent updates `count`

### ❌ Without `useCallback`:

* `handleClick` is a new function on every render
* ❌ Child **re-renders unnecessarily** every time parent changes

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters:

In big apps, re-rendering child components when not needed can **slow things down**.
So `useCallback` helps **optimize performance** when:

* You pass functions to child components
* Child uses `React.memo` to avoid re-rendering
