In your code:

```jsx
<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
<input id="email" type="email" name="email" />
```

`htmlFor` is the **React version of the HTML attribute `for`** in `<label>`.

* In plain HTML, youâ€™d write:

  ```html
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  ```
* In React (JSX), `for` is a reserved JavaScript keyword, so React renamed it to `htmlFor`.

**Purpose:**
It links the `<label>` to a specific form input using the `id` of that input.
When linked:

* Clicking the label will focus or activate the associated input.
* Helps accessibility tools like screen readers correctly read the label for that field.

So in your example:

* `<label htmlFor="email">` is tied to `<input id="email">`.
* If a user clicks **"Email"**, the cursor will jump into the email text box.
