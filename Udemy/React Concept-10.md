#### Example 2: Component wrapper

```jsx
<CustomWrapper>
  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
</CustomWrapper>
```

Here, `<CustomWrapper>` is a **React component** that wraps the `<h1>`.

So yes — whether you're using:

* An HTML tag like `<div>`, `<h1>`, etc.
* Or a **React component** like `<App>`, `<Cart>`, `<Layout>`

They all behave as wrappers.

---

### ✅ Do we need to care whether it’s a component or not?

In **basic use**, no — you don’t need to **know whether something is a component or an HTML tag** as long as it wraps children.

But in **React development**, you eventually **do need to know**:

* **HTML elements** (e.g., `div`, `h1`) render directly to the DOM.
* **Components** (e.g., `Layout`, `Shop`) are **custom JavaScript functions** or classes that return JSX — they can have logic, state, props, effects, etc.

---

### ✅ Example difference:

```jsx
// HTML tag
<h1>Hello</h1>

// React Component
function Header() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
<Header />
```

Both render the same output. But `Header` is reusable and can contain logic.

---

### ✅ Final takeaway:

You're absolutely right that:

> "We don’t need to know whether it’s a component or not when writing `<h1>Hi</h1>`."

But as your app grows, **knowing the difference between tags and components helps you reason about structure, reuse, props, and logic**.

### 🔁 What does nesting look like?

You can place one component **inside** another — just like HTML.

---

### ✅ Example: Wrapping with Nested Components

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Header />
      <MainContent />
      <Footer />
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

Here:

* `<Layout>` is the **wrapping component**.
* Inside it, you **nest other components**: `<Header>`, `<MainContent>`, `<Footer>`.

---

### 🧠 What does this do?

You're building a **component tree**, where each component can:

* Receive children or props
* Contain logic or styles
* Further wrap or nest more components

---

### ✅ Example with `children`:

```jsx
function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="layout">
      <h1>My Site</h1>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now in `App`:

```jsx
<Layout>
  <Header />
  <MainContent />
</Layout>
```

This renders:

```html
<div class="layout">
  <h1>My Site</h1>
  <main>
    <Header />
    <MainContent />
  </main>
</div>
```

---

### 🔁 Nesting inside nesting

```jsx
<App>
  <Layout>
    <Sidebar />
    <Content>
      <Post />
      <Comment />
    </Content>
  </Layout>
</App>
```

You can **nest as deep as you need**, as long as each component is properly defined.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

Yes — React lets you:

* Use **wrapping components**
* Nest **other components** inside
* Pass and render them using `props.children`

This is what makes React powerful for building reusable, modular UI.
